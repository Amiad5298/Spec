"""Step 4: Update Documentation - Automated Doc Maintenance.

This module implements the fourth step of the workflow - automatically
updating documentation based on code changes made during the session.

Philosophy: Keep docs in sync with code. If code changed, docs should
reflect those changes before the user commits.

## Task Summary
Review the code changes made in this workflow session and update any
documentation files that need to reflect these changes.

## Changes Made (git diff)
```diff
{truncated_diff}
```

## Instructions
1. Analyze what functionality was added or changed
2. Identify which documentation files need updates
3. Make targeted updates to keep docs in sync with code
4. Report what was updated

Focus on README.md, API docs, and any relevant documentation files.
Do NOT update docs for unchanged code."""
