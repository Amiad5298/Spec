"""Cursor IDE CLI-mediated ticket fetcher using MCP integrations.

This module provides the CursorMediatedFetcher class that fetches
ticket data through the Cursor CLI's MCP tool integrations for
Jira, Linear, and GitHub.

CursorMediatedFetcher inherits all behaviour from AgentMediatedFetcher.
Only the `name` property is overridden; everything else (platform support,
prompt building, timeout handling, response parsing) lives in the base class.
