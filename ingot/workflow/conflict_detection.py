CONFLICT_DETECTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Analyze the following ticket information and user-provided constraints & preferences for semantic conflicts.

TICKET INFORMATION:
{ticket_info}

USER-PROVIDED CONSTRAINTS & PREFERENCES:
{user_context}

TASK: Determine if there are any semantic conflicts between the ticket and the user's constraints & preferences.
Conflicts include:
- Contradictory requirements (e.g., ticket says "add feature X" but user says "remove feature X")
- Scope mismatches (e.g., ticket is about backend but user constraints discuss frontend changes)
- Incompatible constraints (e.g., different target versions, conflicting technical approaches)

RESPOND IN EXACTLY THIS FORMAT:
CONFLICT: [YES or NO]
SUMMARY: [If YES, provide a 1-2 sentence summary of the conflict. If NO, write "No conflicts detected."]

Be conservative - only flag clear contradictions, not mere differences in detail level."""
